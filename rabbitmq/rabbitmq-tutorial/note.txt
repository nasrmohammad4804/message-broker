//notice for send message on multiple server or machine with rabbit
at first we create fanout exchange
and every server need to consume message need to create default queue(generate with random name) and
bind it to fanout exchange that we introduced in last step
after that we subscribe to this queue in application
and consume all message send to fanout exchange routed to all queue bind it
and we now only on application can consume queue and after connection closed
then queue automatically deleted
//then with this approach we can send a message to multiple server

note about expression in topic exchange

first thing you need to consider in topic exchange every word separate from each other by .
mean your routing key with 3 word like asia.iran.tehran

1. use *
2. use #

1) if you using * you can place only one word for example asia.iran.*
only accept asia.iran.isfahan or asia.iran.qom
but if you want to don't put any word on this place or replace more than one word not accept
for example asia.iran or asia.iran.tehran.damavand not accept

2) if you using # you can replace no word or one word either more that one word is acceptable
for example if you set asia.iran(as no word) or asia.iran.shiraz(as one word) or asia.iran.tehran.damavand(as more than one word ) accepted
better than to use # at the end of phrase
